sourcegraph uses regex search based, you have to manually enable precise

dont need batch changes

could use code insights to track favorite searches, what im always searching for

Code insights surface higher-level, aggregated information to leaders in engineering organizations in dashboards. For example, code insights can track the number of matches of a search query over time, the number of code intelligence diagnostic warnings in a code base, usage of different programming languages, or even data from external services, like test coverage from Codecov.
Sample use cases for this are for tracking migrations, usage of libraries across an organization, tech debt, code base health, and much more.
