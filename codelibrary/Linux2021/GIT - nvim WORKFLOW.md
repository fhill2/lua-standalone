videos of built in vim diff features:

[Vim universe. Vim as a diff tool](https://youtu.be/zEah_HDpHzc)

2 ways to enter diff mode:
1 vim instances. start 2nd instance with `vim -d file1 file2` or vimdiff instead of vim -d


2 open 2 windows with :vsplit in current instance, then `:diffthis`
`:diffsplit file1` command will open a split and open fil1, and then willl enter diffmode on the 2 files

diffopt controls options for the diffmode
filler=doesnt remove empty lines, you want this. like github
context:
`set diffopt=vertical, filler`

[diff algorithm](https://youtu.be/zEah_HDpHzc?t=414)
uses the same algorithm as git
sometimes messes up on new lines

delete removes an untracked file. if its already tracked it will checkout whatever is already in your remote
