sidebar with a project like vscode

and run current and last file command DONE
jump to errmg

scroll a fixed amount up down terminal like pgdown

hving tabs per split:
you can keep your main scripts open and switch between 2 lower level interfaces you are programming
___

FIX for jump errmsg:
when running command, it also sets active file
then when opening err msg, opens in window that isnt showing active file

on trigger, scan windows. if file is open already in the windows, focus that window and go to linne

if file isnt open in any of windows, then create a new buffer if it doesnt exist already
if it does, dont create it then focus it to and open buffer on the rightmost window, go to line with err

test run last file


from x import y <-- can be cython files
packages in site-packages
built in library
your codebase --> cython or python codebase

make sure it works for functions and classes


___
make sure lsp workspace sees the higher up repos
