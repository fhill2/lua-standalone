it is on my todo list to make kitty window management  
even more powerful with **docked windows, and overlay windows that can  
overlay an entire layout.**

OP cant specify the size of the window when opening with kitty @ new_window, and he cant resize it 6 lines

goyal: 
kitty's layout system does not really support fixed size windows, and in  
more complex layouts such as the grid layout or the new splits layout  
there is no way to have this at all.

Conclusion: still being worked on by goyal to have docked windows
