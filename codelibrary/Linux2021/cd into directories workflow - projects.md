ways I can do this:
use xplr

telescope z
file browser


telescope extensions (going through all of them on their site)

https://github.com/cljoly/telescope-repo.nvim



https://github.com/ahmedkhalf/project.nvim
what this does:
everytime you open a file, it checks for that file's git root
if it finds one, it adds the root as a project to the telescope list, and then shows a list of "recent projects"
