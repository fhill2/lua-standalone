does filer have drag & drop?



external filer is implemented in vimscript
https://github.com/akiyosi/goneovim/issues/71


cant use file explorer because doesnt have drag & drop..is implemented in vimscript so would be annoying to customize

workspaces are useless because they only show up in file explorer
